 in Reviews, Switch | 0 comments System: Switch Release date: May 14, 2024 Developer: Experiment 101 Publisher: THQ NordicTHQ Nordics Biomutant had a rocky upbringing. Much like the pint sized, furry denizens of the games open world, the origins of this troubled title are mired in mystery, and drawn out over what feels like eons. Back when the game was originally announced, it showed a level of promise and originality that genuinely raised eyebrows. Much ado was made about how the games developer, Experiment 101, had a level of creative liberty that  in this day and age  was uncommon. If anything, Biomutant exuded that Double A feeling  a game that was allowed to be what its creators wanted to be, unconstrained by the expectations of executive decision makers. Fast forward to the games launch in 2021 for PS4, Xbox One and PC  and then again to 2024, and weve been graced with a port of Biomutant for the Switch.
